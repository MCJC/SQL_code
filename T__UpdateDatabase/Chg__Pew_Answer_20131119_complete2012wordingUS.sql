       =   'Two former teachers are suing the Lee County School District saying their school''s principal discriminated against them and declined to re-hire them after learning they are Jehovah''s Witnesses. […] In December 2010, Bell held a faculty meeting where she demanded the entire faculty participate in a mandatory Christmas activity, emphasizing "I don''t care what religion you are," according to the suit. After the meeting, the Rosaleses wrote Bell an email explaining their religion doesn''t permit celebrating Christmas. The email went unanswered, according to the lawsuit, and the Rosaleses didn''t attend the Christmas event. | In a friend-of-the-court brief filed on April 12, the Civil Rights Division argued that a church in Montgomery County, Maryland, that had been prevented by the county from building an 800-seat church on a 119-acre site, had set forth facts that could show that the county imposed a "substantial burden" on the church''s religious exercise in violation of the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (RLUIPA). Bethel World Outreach Ministries currently serves a congregation of 2,000 by holding multiple services at two locations in Montgomery County. In 2004, the church purchased a 119-acre parcel of land in the county in a zone that at the time permitted churches. The church began the process of planning construction of a large church. Subsequent zoning changes had the effect of blocking the development. […] A provision in a Mississippi city''s zoning ordinance requiring churches to obtain approval from 60% of neighboring property owners is invalid under RLUIPA, the United States argued in a friend-of-the-court brief filed on March 13. The brief, filed in Opulent Life Church v. City of Holly Springs in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, asks the court to vacate a lower court ruling against the church. Opulent Life Church is a small independent church in Holly Springs, Mississippi that entered a lease to rent a larger space in the city''s central business district, and applied for zoning approval, which was denied. The City Code applies "supplemental standards" to churches and other places of worship, requiring approval of the Mayor and Board of Alderman, and the approval of 60% of property owners within a 1,300 foot radius. […] On March 29, the Civil Rights Division filed a brief in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas in support of a Muslim prisoner''s claim under RLUIPA that he should be allowed to wear a short beard for religious purposes. The brief, points out that approximately 7,000 Texas inmates with a skin condition making shaving difficult are permitted to wear short beards. The brief directs the court to another recent brief filed by the Civil Rights Division in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in a nearly identical case, Garner v. Livingston. That case was discussed in detail in the January issue of Religious Freedom in Focus. (DOJ Religious Freedom in Focus Newsletter April 2012: http://www.justice.gov/crt/spec_topics/religiousdiscrimination/newsletter/focus_51.html) | On June 12, the Civil Rights Division filed a friend-of-the-court brief with the U.S. Court of Appeal for the Eleventh Circuit arguing that a federal trial court erred in granting summary judgment to a Georgia city in a mosque''s suit under the RLUIPA. The suit, Islamic Center of North Fulton v. City of Alpharetta, arose out of the city''s denial of a permit for the Islamic Center to expand on a site it has occupied since 1998. The Islamic Center of North Fulton currently worships in a 2,500 square foot mosque that it built after it acquired the property in 1998. Since then, its congregation has grown from 25 to approximately 600 members. It sought a permit in 2010 to build a 12,000 square foot mosque and a 1,910 square foot fellowship hall on the 4.2 acre site. The space was needed to have enough room for worship, facilities for ritual washing before prayer, spiritual counseling, a religious library, and youth activities. The Islamic Center identified several similarly sized church projects that the county has approved in recent years. After the County council denied the Islamic Center''s application in May 2010, the Center filed a federal suit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. On January 25, 2012, the court granted summary judgment for the County. The United States'' brief argues that the district court erred in the standard it used to evaluate the mosque''s claim that the permit denial imposed a "substantial burden" on its religious exercise in violation of RLUIPA Section 2(a), as well as its claim that it was subject to religious discrimination in violation of RLUIPA Section 2(b)(2). For the substantial burden claim, the trial court held that the Center had not demonstrated that its members were "forced or coerced into abandoning, modifying, or violating their religious beliefs." Surveying the case law in the Eleventh Circuit, the United States concludes that this was an inappropriate standard. Rather, in evaluating substantial burden, a court should examine "whether the denial of the permit, viewed against the totality of the circumstances, actually and substantially inhibits the Center''s religious exercise, rather than merely inconveniencing it." The center alleged facts that could show this, and thus their claim should be permitted to go to trial. […] In a brief filed on May 25, the Civil Rights Division argued that the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (RLUIPA) lawsuit of a Santa Fe, New Mexico church, which was denied approval to build a church on a site where it had previously worshipped for 14 years in a temporary structure, should be permitted to move forward. The United State''s amicus brief, filed with the U.S. District Court in New Mexico in O Centro Espirita Beneficente Uniao do Vegetal v. County of Santa Fe, contends that the church alleged sufficient facts to support a claim under RLUIPA, and that its suit should not be dismissed. O Centro Espirita Beneficente Uniao do Vegetal (UDV) is a church that has been worshipping in Santa Fe since 1992, first in a temporary hut, called a yurt, on a property in a rural residential area for 14 years, and for the last 6 years in rented space in Santa Fe. UDV is a Christian Spiritist religion that was originally founded in Brazil over 60 years ago. The church has outgrown its current rented facilities, and has inadequate worship space and child-care facilities to meet the needs of its 80 members. It applied for a permit to build a church for 100 people on its property. The Board of County Commissioners, after holding two lengthy public hearings at which opponents voiced complaints about the UDV church and its use of hoasca tea, denied UDV''s application in October 2011. UDV''s application is the only application by a church that has been denied since 1981; 54 other applications have been approved by the County. UDV filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of New Mexico on February 2, 2012, alleging that the Board''s permit denial violated RLUIPA and other constitutional and statutory provisions. The complaint alleges that the County''s actions violate RLUIPA by imposing a substantial burden on its worship without compelling justification, by treating it less favorably than nonreligious assemblies, and by discriminating against it based on its particular religion. The County filed a motion to dismiss UDV''s complaint on March 29, claiming, in part, that UDV did not state a claim under RLUIPA. (DOJ Religious Freedom in Focus Newsletter June 2012: http://www.justice.gov/crt/spec_topics/religiousdiscrimination/newsletter/focus_52.html) | On August 14, 2012, the Civil Rights Division filed suit against the Florida Department of Corrections ("FDOC") alleging that FDOC''s refusal to provide kosher meals burdens the religious exercise of Florida prisoners in violation of the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000 (RLUIPA). The suit charges that FDOC discontinued its prior kosher food program in 2007 despite a warning from an FDOC study group that terminating the program would likely violate federal law. Since FDOC discontinued the kosher program, the suit alleges, several hundred FDOC prisoners of various faiths have been forced to violate their religious beliefs on a daily basis by consuming non-kosher food. […] On July 18, a federal District Court in Nashville ordered a Tennessee county to process the Islamic Center of Murfreesboro''s application for a certificate of occupancy for its new mosque, and to disregard a state court order to the contrary. The federal court found that following the state court order likely would violate RLUIPA. The state Chancery Court had entered that order on June 13 in a suit brought by Rutherford county residents opposed to the mosque. In the July 18 ruling, the federal court granted the United States'' motion for a temporary restraining order filed in conjunction with a RLUIPA lawsuit filed the same day. Following the federal court order, the county granted a temporary occupancy permit on August 7, and a permanent certificate of occupancy on August 23. The converted office space in which it had been worshipping was far too small to accommodate its current congregation for weekly prayers, and lacked space for a nursery for children, youth and educational activities, weddings, funerals, and holiday celebrations. In 2009, it purchased land in Rutherford County in a zone where places of worship are allowed as-of-right. In May 2010, the Islamic Center applied for site-plan approval to build a new center, phase one of which was a multi-purpose building housing a mosque and space for other religious activities. After considering the proposal at a regularly scheduled, advertised meeting, the county unanimously approved the site plan. Following the county''s approval, opponents of the mosque filed a lawsuit in state Chancery Court in September 2010 seeking to stop construction. (DOJ Religious Freedom in Focus Newsletter August 2012: http://www.justice.gov/crt/spec_topics/religiousdiscrimination/newsletter/focus_53.html) | On September 19, 2012, the U.S. District Court for the District of South Dakota ruled that the South Dakota Department of Corrections (DOC) violated the institutionalized persons section of RLUIPA by refusing to allow Native American prisoners to use tobacco as part of Lakota religious ceremonies. The decision in Native American Counsel of Tribes v. Weberpreserves the religious rights of hundreds of Native American prisoners in South Dakota. (DOJ Religious Freedom in Focus Newsletter November 2012: http://www.justice.gov/crt/spec_topics/religiousdiscrimination/newsletter/focus_54.html) | On April 22, the Civil Rights Division closed its investigation of Brewer, Maine under the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (RLUIPA), after the city amended its zoning code to treat religious assemblies equally with nonreligious assemblies. The Civil Rights Division opened an investigation in August 2012 after receiving a complaint that the city denied a church''s application for permission to expand within a strip mall in a commercial district. Rock Church is a Christian church that opened approximately six years ago in Bangor. It quickly outgrew its space, and its leadership decided to open a second location in Brewer. In September 2009, Rock Church leased space in the City Center Mall, a strip mall located in Brewer''s Convenience Business District. When the church applied for a renovation permit, the city informed it that churches were not a permitted use in the Convenience Business District. […] On March 8, a federal judge in California entered an agreed order settling the United States'' RLUIPA lawsuit against a California city over its denial of approval for construction of a mosque. The lawsuit, filed along with the agreed order on February 1, alleged that the City of Lomita, located in Los Angeles County south of the City of Los Angeles, violated RLUIPA when it denied a request by the Islamic Center of the South Bay to take down the aging and inadequate structures on its property where it currently worships and construct a new mosque. Since 1985, the Islamic Center has owned and used the property along what is now the Pacific Coast Highway for prayer services, educational programs, fellowship, and other religious activities. Because of the age, size and layout of the structures on its property, some congregants had to pray outdoors under tents and in small outbuildings scattered across the property rather than praying together in the prayer hall. Members complained that in addition to violating their belief that they should worship together, the current arrangements, particularly in cold or inclement weather, created distractions that interfered with their worship. There also is insufficient space for ritual washing required before prayer. Space and weather constraints frequently prevented the Islamic Center from hosting weddings, educational programs, and other fellowship activities that are important to the members'' religious exercise. In 2008 the Islamic Center submitted an application to take down the various buildings and tents on its property and construct a single building to serve as mosque with space for a prayer hall, washing facilities, a library, classrooms, office space, and other rooms. […] On February 20, the Civil Rights Division closed an investigation into allegations that a county jail in Tennessee was denying Muslim prisoners access to religious texts and articles, after the county entered an agreement with the United States and implemented policy changes. In October 2011, the Division opened an investigation of the Sullivan County Jail in Blountville, Tennessee, after receiving complaints about access to religious written materials. The investigation was brought under RLUIPA''s institutionalized persons section, which provides that prisons and jails may not engage in practices that "substantially burden" prisoners'' religious exercise unless the challenged practice is the least restrictive means of achieving a compelling government interest. After conducting a thorough investigation, including a visit to the facility, interviews of Sheriff''s deputies and prisoners, and review of policies, procedures, and records of prisoner requests for religious accommodations, the Division determined that Sullivan County Jail was violating RLUIPA. The review indicated that reforms required by the agreement have been effective, and, on February 20, 2013, the Division notified the County that it was in compliance with the agreement. (DOJ Religious Freedom in Focus Newsletter April 2013: http://www.justice.gov/crt/spec_topics/religiousdiscrimination/newsletter/focus_56.html) | United States v. Village of Airmont: The United States alleges in this suit, filed on June 10, 2005, that a New York village enacted a ban on boarding schools specifically to keep Hasidic Jews, who educate their young men in boarding schools called yeshivas, from settling in the village. The case is pending. (DOJ Protection of Religious Land Use: http://www.justice.gov/crt/spec_topics/religiousdiscrimination/ff_landuse.php) | Among obstacles Indians face are laws prohibiting the use of peyote and other substances in ceremonies and dress codes in public schools, the military, prison, and other institutions prohibiting long hair, prayer bundles, and some religious attire. (Marshall, p417) | In 2009 powerful labor unions and construction lobbyists in Montana complained that Hutterites receive a supposed “competitive advantage” because they do not pay wages to their members, and therefore are not required to provide workers’ compensation insurance. In response, the state passed a new law forcing the Hutterites to provide workers’ compensation insurance for their members. The new law would force the community to violate its 500-year-old commitment to holding all possessions in common, working without expectation of compensation, and refusing to assert legal claims against each other. The new law is also pointless, because the Hutterites already provide expensive, comprehensive medical care to all of their members, regardless of the reason for their illness or injury. Thus, the workers’ compensation requirement does nothing to protect the health of Hutterite workers; it only forces the community to violate its religious beliefs. Unfortunately, because Hutterites shun politics and do not vote, the legislature never consulted them before passing the new law, and was unaware that the law would serve no purpose. When the colony discovered that they would be forced to violate their religious beliefs, they petitioned the Montana state courts for relief. The district court ruled that the law violated the First Amendment, because it was “drafted with such care to apply only to Hutterites,” and because it imposed “property rights concepts [that are] forbidden by the fundamental communal living and community of goods doctrine upon which the [community] is founded.” In a sharply divided, 5–4 ruling, the Montana Supreme Court reversed that decision. The Becket Fund now represents the Hutterites in petitioning the Supreme Court to take up the case and defend the religious freedom of a peaceful religious minority. (Becket Fund: http://www.becketfund.org/hutterite/) | The Becket Fund for Religious Liberty led the charge to legally challenge the Administration’s HHS mandate.  This controversial rule requires religious institutions, in violation of their deeply held religious beliefs, to pay for drugs and services contrary to their teachings, or pay a severe fine. The mandate was issued in August 2011, and the Becket Fund quickly raised the alarm by suing on behalf of both Belmont Abbey College, a Catholic liberal arts college founded by Benedictine monks, and Colorado Christian University, an evangelical college located outside of Denver. After those lawsuits were filed, and after over 100,000 complaints were issued, the administration had a golden opportunity to expand the religious exemption.  However, on January 20, 2012, the administration merely gave such institutions an extra year to comply. The Becket Fund moves forward with this crucial litigation. On February 9, 2012, the Becket Fund  filed on behalf of the Eternal Word Television Network (EWTN), a Catholic news organizations founded 30 years ago by a cloistered nun named Mother Angelica.  On February 21, 2012, the Becket Fund filed on behalf of the Ave Maria University, a school dedicated to living the teachings of the Catholic church. On March 22, 2012, the state of Alabama joined the Becket Fund’s lawsuit on behalf of EWTN, defending their citizens’ rights from offer products against their religious beliefs. On June 28, 2012, The Supreme Court upheld the individual mandate challenge to the Affordable Care Act, but allowed the HHS mandate legal challenges to proceed. On July 18, 2012, Wheaton College, the leading evangelical liberal arts institution, filed a lawsuit in partnership with Catholic University of America, marking the first-ever partnership between Catholic and evangelical institutions to oppose the same regulation in the same court. On September 12, 2012, Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc.,  a privately held retail chain with more than 500 arts and crafts stores in 41 states, filed a lawsuit in the US District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma, opposing the Health and Human Services “preventive services” mandate, which forces the Christian-owned-and-operated business to provide, without co-pay, the “morning after pill” and “week after pill” in their health insurance plan, or face crippling fines up to 1.3 million dollars per day. On October 9, 2012, East Texas Baptist University and Houston Baptist University, filed suit, echoing plea of first Baptist leader, Roger Williams, Universities demand religious freedom. (Becket Fund: http://www.becketfund.org/hhs/) | Wilbur Slockish is the Hereditary Chief of the Klickitat and Cascade Tribes of the Yakima Nation, located in Washington. As Hereditary Chief, Slockish is charged with protecting the tribe’s sacred grounds for religious purposes. In 2008, Mr. Slockish filed a lawsuit. He alleged that the destruction of sacred lands violated several federal laws, including the Religious Freedom Restoration Act and the Free Exercise Clause of the U.S. Constitution. He asked for an order requiring the government to remedy the damage to the sacred site, consult with the tribe on future projects in the area, and compensate tribal members for irreparable harms. Joining Mr. Slockish in his lawsuit are fellow tribal members Johnny Jackson and Carol Logan, together with the Cascade Geographic Society and the Mount Hood Sacred Lands Preservation Alliance. (Becket Fund:http://www.becketfund.org/slockish/) | For nearly sixty years, a statue of Jesus has stood atop the slopes of a ski resort near Whitefish, Montana, as a monument to soldiers who died defending our freedom in World War II. To honor these soldiers, who had sacrificed so much for their country, the Knights of Columbus (Kalispell Council No. 1328) commissioned the statue of Jesus and applied to the United States Forest Service for a permit to place it on Big Mountain. Since 1954, the statue has stood passively on a 25’ x 25’ plot of Forest Service land, near the top of the Whitefish Mountain ResortIn February 2012, the Freedom from Religion Foundation sued to have the statue permanently removed. Just after Memorial Day, on May 31, 2012, The Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, representing the Knights of Columbus and several individuals who have voluntarily maintained the statue for nearly sixty years, joined the lawsuit, demanding that religious symbols be treated on fair grounds with other commercial, historical, and cultural symbols that abound on public land. On June 24, 2013, the District Court ruled in favor of the Becket Fund and dismissed the case. (Becket Fund: http://www.becketfund.org/montanajesusstatue/) | The Becket Fund represents a family-owned pharmacy, Ralph’s Thriftway, and two pharmacists who could be forced out of the pharmacy profession solely because of their religious beliefs. These pharmacists cannot in good conscience dispense Plan B emergency contraception because they believe that life begins at the moment of fertilization, and that Plan B can destroy a fertilized egg. The Becket Fund’s clients then filed suit to prevent the new regulation from forcing them out of their profession. They argued that forcing pharmacists to dispense Plan B in violation of their religious beliefs violated their Constitutional right to the free exercise of religion. On February 22, 2012, Judge Leighton, struck down the law requiring pharmacies to dispense the drug.  The case is currently on appeal to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. (Becket Fund: http://www.becketfund.org/stormans-v-selecky-washington-2010-%E2%80%93-current/) | Julea Ward was kicked out of her Eastern Michigan University’s counseling program after she declined to counsel a student against her religious beliefs.  Ward lost in the lower courts but on January 27, 2012, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati held that the University was “permitting secular exemptions but not religious ones and failing to apply the policy in an even-handed, much less a faith-neutral, manner to Ward.” (Becket Fund: http://www.becketfund.org/ward/) | the City of Leon Valley, Texas refused to allow a church, the Elijah Group, use its building for worship. The city enacted a new zoning ordinance with a retail corridor intended to boost tax revenues for the city. The ordinance prohibited churches from the corridor while allowing nonreligious assemblies like theaters, auditoriums and private clubs. The Elijah Group sought a zoning change to allow it to worship in its new church, which the city denied. The Elijah Group sued the city, arguing that the city’s code was unenforceable under the RLUIPA, because the city was not treating the church the same as secular assemblies. The district court sided with the city, but the Fifth Circuit held that the city had indeed violated RLUIPA. (Becket Fund: http://www.becketfund.org/elijah-group-v-city-of-leon-valley-texas-2010-present/) | In April 2005, Kawal Tagore reported to her job with the IRS at the Leland federal building in downtown Houston, as she always did. But that day was different: her supervisor sent her away from the office and told her not to return. Ms. Tagore had recently been baptized in the Sikh faith. She thus begun carrying a kirpan, one of the five articles of faith that all baptized Sikhs are required to carry. A kirpan is an emblem resembling a small knife with a blunt, curved blade. It is a symbol that is meant to remind Sikh believers of their commitment to a just and humane society. She worked from home for about nine months before she was fired altogether. The Becket Fund is defending Ms. Tagore’s right to wear her kirpan as a symbol of her faith. Her case will set an important precedent for other members of the Sikh community seeking to serve their country as federal employees. (Becket Fund: http://www.becketfund.org/tagore-v-dept-of-homeland-security-houston-tx-2010-present/) | Max Moussazadeh is an observant Jew confined in the Texas prison system. When he asked the state to accommodate his religious beliefs by providing him with a kosher diet, the state refused. Thus, in October 2005, The Becket Fund joined forces with megafirm Latham & Watkins LLP and filed a lawsuit against Texas. The lawsuit alleges that the state has unlawfully restricted Mr. Moussazadeh’s religious exercise in violation of the RLUIPA. After the Becket Fund filed suit, Texas established a “kosher kitchen” at one of its prison facilities and began providing a kosher diet. But it still denies kosher food to Jewish inmates who are transferred away from that facility. On December 21, 2012, the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in favor of Max Moussazedeh. (Becket Fund: http://www.becketfund.org/moussazadeh/) | Consider the recent policy imposed by the Illinois State government to force pharmacists to sell emergency contraceptives, including “morning after” and “week after” pills. For Luke Vander Bleek and Glenn Kosirog, this requirement was deeply troublesome because their religious beliefs prohibited them from selling these products. Governor Blagojevich announced that pharmacists with religious beliefs about these drugs should “find another profession.”  the Circuit Court ruled the law was invalid for violating two state laws designed to protect religious liberty, as well as unconstitutional for violating the Free Exercise of Religion clause in the First Amendment. On December 10, 2012, the State of Illinois declined to appeal the favorable ruling, delivering a final victory Luke Vander Bleek and Glenn Kosirog. (Becket Fund: http://www.becketfund.org/morr-fitz/) | the Becket Fund filed an amicus brief to aid the New Mexico Supreme Court in its review of the case of an Albuquerque photographer forced to pay almost $7,000 for declining to photograph a same-sex commitment ceremony. The lower court had refused to apply NMRFRA, holding that it did not apply to a suit that did not involve a government party. (Becket Fund: http://www.becketfund.org/becket-fund-amicus-brief-in-willock-v-elane-photography-argues-that-rfra-applies-to-private-suits/) | Last year the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene issued a new circumcision regulation. It penalizes Jewish rabbinical officials known as mohels who engage in the millennia-old circumcision practice of metzitzah b’peh unless the mohels force the infant boy’s parents to sign a form stating the City’s disapproval of the religious practice. The mohels believe the form to be both factually false and an unwarranted interference in a religious practice that has gone on for literally thousands of years. Several rabbis who act as mohels, along with several Orthodox Jewish rabbinical and community organizations, sued in Brooklyn federal district court, raising both freedom of speech and freedom of religion claims. The federal district court denied the rabbis’ request. The rabbis then appealed to the federal Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in New York, arguing that because New York City’s regulation targeted a specific religious practice, the highest form of judicial constitutional review — “strict scrutiny” — was required under the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment. That is especially so because of documented levels of strong hostility towards Orthodox Jews and their religiously motivated practices in New York and surrounding municipalities.

This year, all nine Supreme Court justices characterized the government’s position as “remarkable” and unanimously rejected it.
